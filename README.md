### OVERVIEW

The Java File Manager is a simple yet efficient command-line tool that allows users to create, read, write, and modify text files. Built using core Java file-handling techniques, this project provides an interactive menu for seamless file operations. It is an excellent resource for beginners learning Java‚Äôs I/O operations and a handy tool for developers managing text files.

The program enables file creation, ensuring a text file is generated if it doesn‚Äôt already exist. Users can write new content, replacing existing data, or append text while preserving previous content. The read function displays the file‚Äôs contents, making it easy to review stored information.

This project demonstrates Java‚Äôs I/O classes (File, FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader) and includes proper exception handling to manage errors like missing files or permission issues. It is useful for students, developers, and professionals needing a lightweight file management tool.

The Java File Manager can be expanded with additional features such as search, delete, or encryption, making it a flexible and educational project for anyone working with file processing in Java.
